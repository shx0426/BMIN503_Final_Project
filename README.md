# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

There are studies using Genome-wide meta-analysis (GWAS) to analyse family history of Alzheimer's disease and identify new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk. However, the sample number of each study is under 500,000. By putting together data from 6 different studies, I plan to look into whether common conclusions could be drawn from them, and if there is difference when comparing maternal and paternal history. I use data from 6 different studies posted on [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/efotraits/EFO_0009268), with a sample number of 9,653,950 SNPs in total. The study identified several genes, including NECTIN2 and AC011481.1, as AD-associated loci that have known and putative biological processes associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Using published consortium data and clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy data, 32 risk loci were identified in total, implicating 247 potential causative genes.
